# EduDash Migration Progress Report

> **Last Updated:** 2026-04-25
> **Status:** Phase 5 In Progress (Foundation Complete)
> **Current Focus:** Dashboard wiring, canvas persistence, and chart integration

This document tracks the end-to-end migration of the EduDash platform from its original monolithic Vanilla HTML/JS structure to a robust, enterprise-grade Angular 17+ and .NET 8 Clean Architecture stack.

## Agent Alpha (Backend Specialist)

**Objective:** Build a Clean Architecture .NET 8 Web API serving sub-50ms responses via `AsNoTracking()` Entity Framework queries.

### Things Done:
- **API Pipeline Creation:** Scaffolded the core API endpoints to serve data tailored for the frontend dashboards.
- **Data Contracts:** Modeled internal domain entities and created tailored Application Layer DTOs that strictly map to the `tech-stack.json` requirements.
- **Infrastructure:** Implemented fast data-access repository patterns and EF Core bindings.
- **MCQ Hardening:** Refactored the core Quiz/MCQ logic for secure, server-side grading and answer validation.
- **Import Utility Pipeline:** Built and tested a robust Excel import utility (with SHA-256 deduplication and idempotent workers) to rapidly ingest questions for the new interface.

### Directories Touched/Created (Backend):
- `/Application/DTOs/` - Data Transfer Objects for frontend consumption
- `/Infrastructure/Data/` - Entity Framework configurations and fast read models
- `/API/Controllers/` - RESTful routing endpoints

## Agent Beta (Angular UI Specialist)

**Objective:** Break down the monolithic `interview-prep-dashboard.html` and 9 other standalone vanilla files into a strict Angular 17 Standalone Component structure powered by Tailwind CSS.

### Things Done:

#### Phase 1: Shared Components
- **Task:** Create the foundational "dumb" UI atoms that are reused across the entire application.
- **Created Components:**
  - `<app-stat-card>`: Displays top-level metrics.
  - `<app-activity-heatmap>`: GitHub-style contribution grid.
  - `<app-code-block>`: Terminal-styled pre/code blocks.
  - `<app-premium-checkbox>`: Custom styled toggle for checklists.
  - `<app-badge>`: Informational pill-tags.
- **Directories Created:**
  - `src/app/shared/components/stat-card/`
  - `src/app/shared/components/activity-heatmap/`
  - `src/app/shared/components/code-block/`
  - `src/app/shared/components/premium-checkbox/`
  - `src/app/shared/components/badge/`

#### Phase 2: Dashboard Feature
- **Task:** Port the main `interview-prep-dashboard.html` into a feature view.
- **Created Components:**
  - `DashboardComponent` (Main Wrapper)
  - `<app-radar-chart>` (Sub-component)
  - `<app-streak-counter>` (Sub-component)
  - `<app-continue-learning>` (Sub-component)
- **Directories Created:**
  - `src/app/features/dashboard/`
  - `src/app/features/dashboard/components/...`

#### Phase 2.5: Interview Canvas Feature
- **Task:** Port the interactive preparation canvas layout out of the dashboard monolith.
- **Created Components:**
  - `InterviewCanvasComponent` (Main Wrapper)
  - `<app-jd-resume-checklist>` (Interactive boolean checklist)
  - `<app-pitch-strategy>` (Content-editable mock area)
  - `<app-qa-accordion>` (Expandable hint/answer layout)
  - `<app-keyword-card>` (Rich text definitions)
- **Directories Created:**
  - `src/app/features/interview-canvas/`
  - `src/app/features/interview-canvas/components/...`

#### Phase 3: Skill Tree Feature
- **Task:** Migrate the complex `skill-tree.html.html` file involving SVG rendering.
- **Accomplished:** Abstracted vanilla DOM manipulation into pure Angular component logic (`ngOnInit` and `@HostListener`) to programmatically draw SVG bezier curves connecting DOM node elements.
- **Directories Created:**
  - `src/app/features/skill-tree/`

#### Phase 4: Interactive Lessons
- **Task:** Centralize the disparate learning mini-apps into a single routed view.
- **Created Components:**
  - `InteractiveLessonsComponent` (Tabbed Layout Shell)
  - `<app-forum-quiz>` (From `interactive_forum_quiz.html`)
  - `<app-interactive-graph>` (From `graph.html`. Ported D3.js physics simulation into `ngAfterViewInit`)
  - `<app-venn-diagram>` (From `venn-diagram-interactive.html`. Bound Angular state to complex SVG clip-paths)
  - `<app-sql-table>` (From `sql-code-table.html`. Transformed hardcoded hover interactions into `@for` row bindings)
- **Directories Created:**
  - `src/app/features/interactive-lessons/`
  - `src/app/features/interactive-lessons/components/...`

### Global Configuration Changes (Agent Beta)
- `src/app/app.routes.ts`: Set up lazy-loaded routing for `dashboard`, `interactive-lessons`, and `skill-tree`.
- `src/app/app.component.html`: Upgraded vanilla shell `<a href="#">` tags to Angular `routerLink` active tags.
- `src/app/app.config.ts`: Instantiated global icon providers via `LucideAngularModule.pick(icons)`.
- `package.json`: Installed `lucide-angular`, `chart.js`, `d3`, and `@types/d3`.

## Agent Gamma (State & Logic Integrator)

With the HTML, CSS, and component structure strictly ported and compiling successfully, Phase 5 state and logic integration is now underway.

### Things Done:

#### Phase 5.1: Foundation Alignment
- **Task:** Align the Angular frontend with the backend contract that actually exists today instead of the earlier placeholder `/api/dashboard` assumption.
- **Completed:**
  - Reworked dashboard DTOs in `src/app/core/models/dashboard.model.ts` to match the current backend `GET /api/dashboard/tech-stack` response shape.
  - Updated `ApiService` to expose `getTechStack()` for the real backend route.
  - Rebuilt `DashboardStore` with Angular Signals for `techStack`, `loading`, and `error`, with computed selectors for `devHexagon`, `skills`, and `primaryMetrics`.
  - Avoided introducing phantom metrics, heatmap, and radar API contracts before those endpoints exist.

#### Phase 5.2: Canvas State Foundation
- **Task:** Prepare the Interview Canvas for real persistence while preserving Agent Beta's UI structure.
- **Completed:**
  - Reshaped `src/app/core/models/canvas.model.ts` to match the current checklist, pitch strategy, and Q&A accordion state already used in the UI.
  - Extended `CanvasStore` with Angular Signals and LocalStorage-backed rehydration using the `eduDash_canvasState` key.
  - Added explicit store actions for JD/resume checklist toggles, pitch checkbox state, editable pitch text fields, Q&A expand/collapse state, Q&A completion toggles, reset behavior, and add-Q&A behavior.
  - Kept canvas persistence browser-local until a real `/api/canvas` contract is introduced.

#### Verification
- **Build Validation:** Confirmed the Angular app still builds successfully after the Phase 5 foundation changes.
- **Notes:** The build passes with an existing frontend bundle budget warning still present.

### Current Remaining Queue:
1. Connect `DashboardComponent` to the new `DashboardStore` and map live backend data into the existing stat, heatmap, and radar UI shell as endpoints become available.
2. Wire `InterviewCanvasComponent` and its child components to `CanvasStore` so interactions persist instantly to LocalStorage.
3. Implement `Chart.js` rendering inside `RadarChartComponent` using Angular lifecycle-safe initialization and cleanup.

### Error Fixes & Refinements (Phase 5)
- **Icon Resolution:** Fixed `check-circle-2` and `check-circle` resolution errors by converting them to the correctly supported `circle-check` Lucide alias.
- **ViewChildren Crash:** Resolved `TypeError: def.findHostDirectiveDefs is not a function` by moving IntersectionObserver logic entirely into `ngAfterViewInit` and safely checking array length before `.forEach` execution.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Adjusted landing page dimensions, tile ratios (3D Hero Mockup grid converted to `md:grid-cols-12` and stacked on mobile), the Omnibar placement (`top-4` vs `top-6`), the Tactile Playground box sizes, and added a responsive `overflow-x-auto` wrapper for the Skill tree SVG to preserve dimensions on phone screens.
